# ISS Objectives and Analysis Scope

### OBJECTIVES OF ISS

#### Overall objective

Enhance the quality, efficiency, and accountability of Rwanda’s education system by using AI and IoT to monitor classroom activities, improve teaching and learning outcomes, and optimize resource use.

#### Specific objectives

- **Improve student learning and engagement** by monitoring mood, attention, attendance, focus, participation, behavior, cheating, and use of unauthorized items to enable early support and personalized interventions.
- **Enhance teacher effectiveness and accountability** by tracking teaching time, idle time, movement, engagement with students, and classroom management to support professional development.
- **Optimize the classroom environment** by monitoring temperature, humidity, lighting, noise, air quality, and occupancy to maintain good learning conditions.
- **Reduce time wasted for teachers and parents** by automating attendance, progress monitoring, and reporting.
- **Prevent resource loss** by detecting theft, unauthorized device use, and misuse of consumables.
- **Lower dropout and absenteeism** by providing early warnings for at-risk students and enabling timely interventions.
- **Increase digital literacy** by exposing students, teachers, and school leaders to practical AI and IoT applications.
- **Link behavioral data with academic performance** to support targeted interventions.
- **Provide data-driven decision support** through dashboards and analytics for school managers, sector and district offices, and MINEDUC.

### WHAT ISS WILL ANALYZE

#### Student-level analysis

- **Behavioral engagement**
    - Eye gaze direction, body posture, head movement, attentiveness, participation, collaboration, note-taking habits, question asking, focus, and motivation.
    - Identifies attentive vs. distracted students.
    - Detects which classroom zones are most attentive.
    - Flags idle or sleeping students.
- **Emotional engagement**
    - Facial expressions such as interest, boredom, confusion, frustration, and joy.
    - Measures emotional response to lessons and teaching style.
- **Cognitive engagement**
    - Smile detection, micro-expressions, reaction to tasks, speed of response in digital quizzes, and time on task.
    - Identifies students who are mentally engaged but quiet.
- **Physical engagement**
    - Movement frequency, sitting upright vs. slouching, and participation gestures.
    - Detects fatigue, restlessness, and unusually high activity levels.
- **Social engagement**
    - Peer interactions, hand-raising frequency, and group collaboration.
    - Tracks misbehavior, bullying, and lateness.
    - Measures collaboration and inclusiveness.
- **Idle time in practical sessions**
    - Detects when students are not participating in lab or workshop activities.
- **Collaborative involvement**
    - Identifies passive students during team tasks or discussions.
- **Attendance and punctuality**
    - Facial-recognition attendance to reduce absenteeism and “ghost” attendance.

#### Teacher-level analysis

- **Instruction time and task focus**
    - Time spent teaching vs. writing, managing the class, or using digital tools.
    - Teaching time utilization, clarity, and impact on student focus.
- **Interaction and engagement**
    - Frequency of interactions with students.
    - Response time to student questions.
- **Movement and presence**
    - Movement patterns (active monitoring vs. static teaching).
    - Coverage of classroom zones.
- **Tone and expression during instruction**
    - Emotional tone and facial expression analysis.
- **Use of teaching aids**
    - Tracks use of boards, screens, and digital tools.
- **Lesson delivery monitoring**
    - Records teaching time, punctuality, absence, lateness, and engagement level.
- **Professional accountability**
    - Links teacher behavior and engagement indicators with student outcomes.

#### Teacher–student interaction analysis

Teacher–student interaction is critical for quality education. ISS uses AI video analytics and audio mapping to quantify how often and how effectively teachers engage students.

- **Communication frequency**
    - Number of verbal exchanges per class.
    - Duration of teacher talk vs. student talk.
    - Question-and-answer frequency.
    - Identifies one-way lectures vs. participatory sessions.
- **Physical proximity**
    - Distance between teacher and students.
    - Engagement across front, middle, and back rows (supports equity analysis).
    - Movement zones covered in the classroom.
- **Eye contact and attention**
    - Teacher gaze direction.
    - Eye-contact duration with students.
- **Feedback behavior**
    - Gestures of approval, correction, and encouragement.
    - Facial emotion during interaction.
    - Measures positive reinforcement and teaching tone.
- **Response to student behavior**
    - Reaction time to raised hands, confusion, or disengagement.
    - Measures responsiveness and attentiveness.
- **Use of teaching aids**
    - Interaction with board, screen, and tools.
    - Assesses digital teaching habits and adaptability.
- **Behavioral correlation**
    - Links interaction indicators with academic performance to identify effective practices.

#### Workshops and computer labs

- **IoT sensors**
    - Monitor machine vibrations, temperature, and power fluctuations to detect malfunction.
- **Visual AI**
    - Detects physical damage, clutter, and malfunction of tools, screens, and furniture.
- **Usage analytics**
    - Flags equipment that is unused, overused, or used abnormally.
- **Environmental sensing**
    - Detects humidity, overheating, unsafe air quality, and overcrowding.
- **Automated alerts**
    - Notifies administrators for preventive maintenance and safety risks.
- **Space utilization**
    - Tracks how lab and workshop spaces are used over time.
- **Maintenance**
    - Detects damaged or idle equipment early.
- **Theft detection**
    - Alerts when unusual objects or movements suggest theft or unauthorized access.
- **Tool and material use**
    - Tracks frequency and duration of tool or machine use.

#### Eradication of cheating in exams and assessments

#### A. Exam environment (classroom or lab)

ISS analyzes:

- Seating patterns (whether students are clustered or spread out).
- Proximity and presence of unauthorized devices.
- Movement patterns (frequent wandering or suspicious repositioning).
- Noise levels (unusual talking, whispering, or disturbances).
- Environmental conditions (lighting, camera visibility, room setup).
- Exam material integrity (missing or misplaced papers or equipment).
- Unauthorized entries, object placement, and camera obstruction.

#### B. Classroom comfort monitoring

- Temperature, humidity, lighting, noise, air quality, and occupancy during exams.
- Alerts when conditions may increase discomfort or reduce visibility and supervision effectiveness.

#### C. Invigilator-level analysis

ISS analyzes:

- Attention patterns (detects distraction or absence from critical areas).
- Consistency with exam protocols (deviations and irregular behavior).
- Response to alerts (how quickly suspicious activity is addressed).
- Presence and movement (vigilance, movement patterns, idle time).
- Professional conduct (phone use, chatting, favoritism).
- Coverage analysis (fairness in room supervision using heatmaps).

#### D. Student-level analysis

ISS analyzes:

- Behavioral signals (whispering, unusual hand movements, repeated head turning, copying).
- Device detection (phones, smartwatches, and other unauthorized electronics).
- Collaboration attempts (eye contact, passing notes, paper exchange).
- Stress indicators (facial expressions and micro-expressions suggesting anxiety or deceit).
- Attendance and identity (right student in the right seat at the right time).
- Attention and focus (gaze direction, posture, and engagement).
